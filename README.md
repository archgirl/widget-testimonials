# Using Airtable w/ Vue.js

This widget/module/whatever-you-want-to-call-it displays Airtable records as list items in a simple Vue app.

This project was created for [@emorgaine](https://twitter.com/emorgaine)'s Adobe Premiere "tutorial" assignment. She needed something cool to work with for video editing, and I needed to figure out how to build an easily editable testimonial slider. Hooray #teamwork!

Vue.js boilerplate for Airtable based on Ryan Hayden's ["A basic introduction to the Airtable API"](https://medium.com/row-and-table/an-basic-intro-to-the-airtable-api-9ef978bb0729)
